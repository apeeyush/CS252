Create a basic web-server with the following pages:

1. Registration page:
	Include username and password and store them encrypted in a MySQL database

2. Upload page:
	Upload files after authenticating based on username and password.
	Rename every file filename.extn as username_filename.extn

3. Statistics page:
	Show all the files upload by a particular user

The uploaded files should go to uploads/ folder.
